I want to write some text here so that I can read them using a python code from another script.
I hope I am able to do it well, and get it once an for all.
Never mind, it is a test file.
It is meant to test how much I understand file reading with python.
What I want to do is open this file in my script and print it out.
There are two ways to do this: I can hard code - directly writing the name of the file to be opened in my script,
or ask the user to enter the name of the file they would like to open.
The second way is much better as it would allow the script to be able to open other files later.
Now, to do this, I will need to use argv or input for users to be able to enter filenames.
