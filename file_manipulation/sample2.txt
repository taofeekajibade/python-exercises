In the file, I provide a simple step-by-step explanation of what the script does.
First, it imports the necessary module as seen at the top of the script.
secondly, it creates two variables - the script name and the filename as arguments.
Third, it opens the file, reads it and print to the stdout.

Next, it prompts the user to enter another filename to be opened and read.
It then repeats the process in line 4 above.
