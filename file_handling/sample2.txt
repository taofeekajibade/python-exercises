In this file, I provide a simple step-by-step explanation of what the script does.
First, it imports the necessary module as seen at the top of the script.
secondly, it creates two variables - the script name and the filename as arguments.
Third, it opens the file, reads it and print to the stdout.

Next, it prompts the user to enter another filename to be opened and read.
It then repeats the process in line 4 above.

The open() function opens a fie, and returns it as a file object. Its syntax is `open(file, mode)`. A fille can be opened in different modes:
    "r" - Read - default value - opens a file for reading.

    "a" - Append - opens a file for appending. It creates the file if it does not already exist.

    "w" - Write - opens a file for writing. It creates one if it does not exist.

    "x" - Create - creates a new file. It returns an error if the file already exists.

Also, it can be specified if the file should be opened in default text ("t") or in binary ("b").I am adding a new content as a demo.I am adding a new content as a demo.
