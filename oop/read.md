```python
class School:

    status = 'private'         # class variable shared by all instances

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name    # instance variable unique to each instance

a = School('Micfis International School')
b = School('Calvary College')

a.status                  # shared by all schools
# output: 'private'
b.status                  # shared by all schools
# output: 'private'
a.name                  # unique to a
# output: 'Micfis International School'
b.name                  # unique to b
# output: 'Calvary College'
```

**Class and Instance Variables**

- In the highlighted text, we see the definition of a class called "School" in Python.
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) that share similar characteristics and behaviours.
- Inside the class, there are two variables defined: "status" and "name".
- The variable "status" is a class variable, which means it is shared by all instances of the class.
- The variable "name" is an instance variable, which means it is unique to each instance of the class.

**Creating Instances of the School Class**

- After defining the School class, the highlighted text shows the creation of two instances of the class: "a" and "b".
- The instances are created by calling the class name as if it were a function, passing the desired arguments.
- In this case, the argument passed is the name of the private.
- The first instance is created with the name 'Micfis International School' and assigned to the variable "a".
- The second instance is created with the name 'Calvary College' and assigned to the variable "b".

**Accessing Class and Instance Variables**

- The highlighted text also demonstrates how to access the class and instance variables of the School class.
- To access a class variable, we use the syntax "class_name.variable_name".
- In this case, we can see that both "d.status" and "e.status" return the value 'private', which is the value of the class variable "status".
- To access an instance variable, we use the syntax "instance_name.variable_name".
- Here, "d.name" returns the value 'Micfis International School', which is the value of the instance variable "name" for the instance "d".
- Similarly, "b.name" returns the value 'Calvary College', which is the value of the instance variable "name" for the instance "b".

**Summary**

- The highlighted text demonstrates the concept of class and instance variables in Python.
- Class variables are shared by all instances of a class, while instance variables are unique to each instance.
- Instances of a class can be created by calling the class name as a function and passing the desired arguments.
- Class and instance variables can be accessed using the syntax "class_name.variable_name" and "instance_name.variable_name" respectively.
