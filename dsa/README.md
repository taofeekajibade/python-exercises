# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHM
This enables us to solve regualr problems using efficient codes. DSA is found in
all languages.
Algorithms are a set of instructions given to a computer to solve a problem.
First, we design them; then, we code them in a programming language. Data
structures hold and manipulate data when we execute an algorithm.
Here, we will build some advanced data structures, like linked lists, stacks, and queues.
A **linked list** is a sequence of data connected through links. Each element is
called a node and is divided into two parts: data and pointer (to the next
        node.) - the last pointer points to null.
The first node is the head and the last node is the tail.
A node with one unidirectional link is called *singly-linked list.* On th4 other
hand, a node with two links on either sides is called *doubly-linked list.*
A linked list can be used to implement other data structure such as stacks,
  queues, graphs.In practical application, it can be used to access infornation
